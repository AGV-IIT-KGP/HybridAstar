#1. Clean code - rename variable (remove temp), remove unnecessary things
2. Time comparison setup
3. For SAT-based collision checker, figure out mapping and map->polygon.
4. For Grid-based-collision checker, figure out mapping costmap.
5. Make launch file.
#6. Write a node for publishing velocity on cmd_vel and then make it 0 once it reaches goal.
7. ReadMe that should explain the hybrid astar frame 50,50 and all other stuff.
8. For map conversion we should use we should use the lidar frame (there is a frame for lidar).

What all to be part of ros parameter file ?
- Bot Length and Bot Width
- Bot Turning Radius
- Bot Max Angle - will decide how many neighbours to be checked for trajectory generation. 
- range threshold that decides how far lidar has to consider data
